# Activity 3 Javascript and DOM

## Calculator example

The code provided in this repository, is the partially completed calculator function.

-**Keys** The keys of the calculator are html `div` tags which are styled to act as button, and can not be selected.

-**Layout** A grid layout `display:grid` is used to put the keys in the right place.

-**Script** the script uses the selectors, to select DOM elements and add event handler

    - Using `delegation` method explained in week 4, the `calculator` element is selected and a listener on click is added to the event listener.

    - Using the `if` statements, the item clicked is identified.

    - in the condition, using the `eval` function, the value in the div is calculated.

 ## Deliverable

  1. Add the missing HTML tags for the missing buttons.
  2. Move the CSS into `style.css` file, and import the css using `style` tag
  3. Complete the missing JS code in the script and complete the code
  4. Move the script into `scripts.js`
